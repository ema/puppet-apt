description 'This module allows you to easily manage your apt repositories

To use this module, add this module  to your puppet repository and add "include apt" to all your nodes. That should do the trick!

There are a couple of defines for well known apt repositories:

* dotdeb.org
* lenny-backports
* mariadb.org
* ourdelta.org
* percona
* puppetlabs
* rabbitMQ
* always looking for more!

Feedback is more then welcome!
