puppet-apt

This is the puppet-apt module.

* Apt module quickly imported from Marco Bonetti's work
* Adapted by Walter Heck <walter@tribily.com> in 2011-09 for Tribily
* Adapted by Walter Heck <walter@openquery.com> in 2011-11 for Open Query

This module allows you to easily manage your apt repositories

To use this module, add this module  to your puppet repository and add "include apt" to all your nodes. That should do the trick!

There are a couple of defines for well known apt repositories:

* dotdeb.org
* lenny-backports
* mariadb.org
* ourdelta.org
* percona
* puppetlabs
* rabbitMQ
* always looking for more!

Feedback is more then welcome!
